## 🔧 How It Works

The app connects to a service called OpenWeatherMap to get real-time weather updates. When you enter a city name, the app asks this service for the latest data and then displays it.

Here is what happens inside the app:

- You type a city name and send the request.
- The app contacts OpenWeatherMap using a special key (API key).
- It receives weather details like temperature, condition, and forecast.
- The app draws a bar chart showing temperature changes over the next hours.
- You can view this data clearly and easily.

This all happens within seconds, keeping you up to date.
